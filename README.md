Environmental Parameters Monitoring System

1.Introduction

    1.1.What was the idea behind it?

  The project is based on a question Iâ€™ve had for a long time(How do people collect weather data?), as we see data from such systems every day, particularly in weather forecasts. For this reason, I decided to create a system to monitor environmental parameters. Its functionality is undeniable, as this type of system is used daily for monitoring and preventing situations where normal thresholds are exceeded.

    1.2.WHAT DOES IT DO?

    
The system relies on a thermal sensor to collect various environmental data and display it on an LCD screen. Using a joystick and a button, we can control the system, allowing us to navigate through the data and adjust the threshold that alerts us when recommended values are exceeded. If these values are surpassed, an LED will signal the danger by changing its color.


    1.3.What is its purpose?

To display environmental data from its surroundings and allow users to manipulate thresholds to alert them in case of environmental danger, similar to large-scale systems that warn humanity in the event of a catastrophe.
